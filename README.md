# Bank Tech Test
This is a small project that will serve as practice for future tech tests. I will make a small applet that will allow a user to deposit money into the account and take money out for the specifications of the client.

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

User specification didn't mention error cases so I added fails if amount given in credit or debit weren't number.

### Installation and running tests
- Clone the repo and rub ```bundle```.
- Run
```
rspec
rubocop
```
in the project directory to check tests and linter.
- Enjoy!

### Usage
- Enter into IRB or preferred ruby REPL.
- ```require './lib/bank'```

This will set up the REPL environment for playing with the code.

Create a new bank class object for yourself with
``` your_name = Bank.new ```

You can use ```.statement``` on the object to get the statement and ```.credit(amount)```/```.debit(amount)``` to add or withdraw money.

~~I ended up adding the time in minutes for when the transaction occured.~~
